# Fun With HTML5 Canvas 
- We will be learning a lot about how the HTML5 element works 
- Like Microsoft paint and you draw on the context (most of the time 2d)
- You'll need a lineJoin, lineCap, and strokeStyle for all of the elements on the canvas 
- We will set a isDrawing variable to false and let set it to true when the mouse is down 
  - We also set last X and last Y because you need to set an ending x and an ending y
