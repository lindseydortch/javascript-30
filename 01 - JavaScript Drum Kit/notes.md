# Getting Setup
- Try to carve out time every single day to get these done 
- Figure out the way you learn best 
- Stayed away from design patterns, classes, closures
- Don't reach for lodash, etc. everything can be done with vanilla JS

# JavaScript Drum Kit
- When you hit the key on your keyboard it will play the associated sound and then will have an animation that will scale up the key to show it's playing 
- Go to keycode.info for the number associated with the key -- already setup using the data- attribute in the html
- We will be using a transition end event, we can listen on each key for when the end event happens
